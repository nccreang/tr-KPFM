# tr-KPFM
Plotting tool for time resolved KPFM data. 

Can take data in the form of .ibw or .hd5.  User will need to make the appropriate changes in the field forms for the size of the scan and direction of the scan. Code will not accept non-square scans (scans stopped early).

Plotting is meant for tr-KPFM scans where slow scan is disabled and voltage is changed throughout the scan.
